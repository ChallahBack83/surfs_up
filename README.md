# Surfs Up

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to understand the temperature trends in Oahu, so we may determine if opening a surf and ice cream shop is sustainable for the year. In this analysis, I am looking specifically at temperature trends in June and December to compare weather patterns in two halves of the year.

## Results
Three major points from 2 analysis deliverables

- Temperature is on average higher for month of June but not by more than 3 degrees (so minimal)
  - The HIGH temperature only has a difference of only 2 degrees more in June.
  - show change differential in percentage 
- Temperatures are more variable in December (line graph or histogram)
  - We will face more lower temps in December on average as lowest temp is 8 degrees lower than June.
  - Look at Mode here ?
  - Avg. temp per day (averages the stations together by date).(histograms)
- 


## Summary
High-Level Sumary of results
Two additonal queries you would perform to gather more weather data for June & December

- Precipitation comparison between two months
    - Still need to merge two datasets
    - merge summaries OR avg. precipitations
- Avg Temp and Precip by Day (histograms instead of formula)
    - Line graph for comparison
- Comparison on specific stations to better select location.
